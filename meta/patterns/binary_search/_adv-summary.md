## Summary: The Complete Mental Model

These 8 concepts form a complete decision framework:

| # | Concept | Key Question |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Inequality Strategy | `<=` vs `<` — which loop style? |
| 2 | Existence vs Optimization | bool vs value — what to return? |
| 3 | Domain Typing | Index vs Value — what are bounds? |
| 4 | Boundary Stability | Why is this correct? |
| 5 | + Greedy Pattern | What's the O(n) feasibility check? |
| 6 | Sentinel Bounds | How to derive bounds? |
| 7 | Failure Modes | How to debug? |
| 8 | vs Alternatives | When NOT to use? |

With these concepts, binary search becomes as **transferable** as sliding window — a systematic approach rather than memorized templates.
