# Pattern Documentation Configuration
# Controls the order of files when composing the final document

# Header files (appear first, typically only _header.md)
header_files = [
    "_header.md"
]

# Problem files (appear in middle, ordered by LeetCode number or custom order)
# Note: Currently two_pointers uses pattern-based organization in _header.md
# If you add individual problem files later, list them here
problem_files = [
    # Example: "0001_two_sum.md",
    # Example: "0011_container_water.md",
]

# Footer files (appear last, typically comparison, decision, mapping, templates)
footer_files = [
    "_comparison.md",
    "_decision.md",
    "_mapping.md",
    "_templates.md"
]
