description = """
Uses bitmask to represent set of completed courses. For each state,
finds courses with prerequisites met, then enumerates all subsets up to size k.
Subset enumeration uses bit manipulation: sub = (sub-1) & available.
"""

[analysis]
key_insight = """
This is an NP-hard problem (related to machine scheduling). n <= 15 enables
bitmask DP approach. Each of n courses is either taken or not, giving 2^n states.
The 3^n complexity comes from iterating over all (taken, available subset) pairs.
