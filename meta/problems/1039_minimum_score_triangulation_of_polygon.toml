[notes]
key_insight = """
For edge (i, j), choose a third vertex k to form a triangle.
This splits the polygon into two smaller polygons with edges (i, k) and (k, j).
Same structure as burst balloons but with geometric interpretation.

common_mistakes = [
    "Starting interval length at 2 instead of 3 (need at least 3 vertices)",
    "Confusing vertex indices with edge indices",
    "Not recognizing the similarity to burst balloons",
