key_insight = """
Use KMP failure function for periodicity detection.
Period = n - failure[n-1]. String is periodic iff:
1. failure[n-1] > 0 (has proper prefix = suffix)
2. n % period == 0 (period divides length)
Alternative: s is periodic iff s appears in (s+s)[1:-1]
"""
common_mistakes = [
    "Getting the period formula wrong (it's n - lps[n-1], not lps[n-1])",
    "Forgetting to check that period divides n",
    "Missing edge case: single character strings",
]
