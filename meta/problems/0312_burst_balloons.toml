[notes]
key_insight = """
Think about which balloon to burst LAST in each interval.
If k is burst last in (i, j), then nums[i] and nums[j] are still boundaries.
Add virtual balloons [1] at boundaries to handle edge cases cleanly.
"""
common_mistakes = [
    "Forgetting to add boundary balloons [1] at start and end",
    "Thinking 'first to burst' instead of 'last to burst'",
    "Wrong interval bounds (exclusive vs inclusive)",
