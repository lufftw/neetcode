time_complexity = "O(1) per operation"
space_complexity = "O(n)"
description = """
Maintain two maps: count[num] = frequency of num,
freq_count[f] = how many distinct numbers have frequency f.
hasFrequency(f) checks freq_count[f] > 0 in O(1).
"""

[analysis]
key_insight = """
The key is maintaining a reverse index: freq_count maps frequencies to
the count of numbers with that frequency. On add/delete, we update both
maps synchronously, decrementing the old frequency count and incrementing
the new one.
"""

edge_cases = [
    "Delete non-existent number (no-op)",
    "hasFrequency before any adds (false)",
    "Multiple numbers with same frequency",
    "Add and immediately delete",
