key_insight = """
Transform cuts into intervals by adding boundaries 0 and n.
Think about which cut to make LAST in each segment.
Cost of last cut = length of segment = cuts[j] - cuts[i].
"""

    "Forgetting to add boundary positions 0 and n",
    "Not sorting the cut positions",
    "Using j - i instead of cuts[j] - cuts[i] for cost",
