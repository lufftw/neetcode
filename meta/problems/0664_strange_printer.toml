[notes]
key_insight = """
Different recurrence from standard interval DP.
When s[k] == s[i], we can extend the first print to cover s[k],
reducing the number of turns needed.
Preprocessing: remove consecutive duplicates.
"""
common_mistakes = [
    "Not removing consecutive duplicate characters",
    "Wrong base case (single char needs 1 turn)",
    "Missing the character matching optimization",
