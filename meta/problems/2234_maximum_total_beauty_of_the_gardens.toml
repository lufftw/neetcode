description = """
Sort gardens by flower count. Enumerate how many gardens become complete
(from right side of sorted array). For remaining incomplete gardens,
binary search for maximum achievable minimum using prefix sums.
"""

[analysis]
key_insight = """
After sorting, complete gardens should be chosen from the right (larger values)
to minimize completion cost. For incomplete gardens, raising the minimum requires
filling up gardens level by level, which can be computed efficiently with prefix sums.
The problem decomposes into: enumerate complete count, then maximize incomplete minimum.
