key_insight = """
Find the longest palindromic prefix, then prepend the reverse of the remaining suffix.
Use KMP on s + '#' + reverse(s): the failure function's last value gives the
longest proper prefix that is also a suffix, which equals the palindrome prefix length.

common_mistakes = [
    "Forgetting the '#' separator (causes false matches across boundary)",
    "Not handling empty string or single character cases",
    "Computing reverse incorrectly",
