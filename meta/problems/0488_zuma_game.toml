description = """
DFS explores all possible ball insertions. After each insertion,
remove consecutive groups of 3+ same-colored balls. Memoize on
(board, sorted_hand) to avoid revisiting states. Pruning: prefer
inserting next to same color.
"""

[analysis]
key_insight = """
The search space is bounded by board states (exponential in board length)
and hand configurations (at most 5! permutations). Memoization on
canonicalized (board, hand) pairs avoids redundant computation.
Key pruning: inserting a ball only helps if it creates or extends
a group of the same color.
"""

edge_cases = [
    "Single ball on board (need 2 more of same color)",
    "Empty result possible with exact hand",
    "Impossible to clear (insufficient balls)",
    "Chain reactions (one insertion triggers multiple removals)",
    "All different colors on board",
