Segment tree supporting range max and range sum queries.

- gather(k, maxRow): Binary search on segment tree for leftmost row with >= k seats
- scatter(k, maxRow): Range sum query + greedy allocation from first available row

Key optimization: Track first_available_row to skip full rows in scatter.
