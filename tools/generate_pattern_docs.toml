# Pattern Documentation Generator Configuration
# Global configuration for pattern documentation generation

# Directory name to API Kernel ID mapping
# Maps pattern directory names to their corresponding API Kernel IDs in ontology
#
# IMPORTANT: Manual configuration is recommended for clarity and maintainability.
# Mapping relationships involve semantic decisions and should be explicitly defined.
#
# The system supports simple auto-inference for unambiguous cases (e.g., 
# sliding_window -> sliding_window_* patterns), but manual configuration 
# takes precedence and is the recommended approach.
