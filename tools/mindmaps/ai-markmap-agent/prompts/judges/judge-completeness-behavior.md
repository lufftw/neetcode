## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Knowledge Coverage (40%)

**Topics Checklist:**

| Category | Expected Topics | Covered | Missing |
|----------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| [Category 1] | [Topic list] | X/Y | [List] |
| [Category 2] | [Topic list] | X/Y | [List] |

| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Core Topics | X | [Are fundamentals covered?] |
| Important Topics | X | [Secondary topics present?] |
| Edge Cases | X | [Special cases mentioned?] |
| **Subtotal** | X/10 | |

**Coverage Gaps:**
1. [Missing topic]

### Step 2: Practical Value (35%)

| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Problem Links | X | [LeetCode references included?] |
| Real Examples | X | [Concrete applications?] |
| Actionable Info | X | [Can users take action?] |
| **Subtotal** | X/10 | |

**Practical Issues:**
1. [Missing practical element]

### Step 3: Depth Balance (25%)

| Area | Depth (Levels) | Node Count | Assessment |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|
| [Area 1] | X | Y | Appropriate/Too deep/Too shallow |
| [Area 2] | X | Y | Assessment |

| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Balanced Depth | X | [Similar depth across areas?] |
| No Neglected Areas | X | [All areas adequately covered?] |
| **Subtotal** | X/10 | |

**Balance Issues:**
1. [Imbalance description]

### Step 4: Learning Path Quality

| Aspect | Present? | Quality |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Beginner section | Yes/No | Good/Poor |
| Progress markers | Yes/No | [x]/[ ] used? |
| Prerequisites shown | Yes/No | Good/Poor |
| Advanced section | Yes/No | Good/Poor |
