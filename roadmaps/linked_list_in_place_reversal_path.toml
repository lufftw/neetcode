key_insight = """
In-place linked list reversal uses the three-pointer technique: prev, curr,
next_node. The core operation is: save next, reverse pointer, advance all.
Segment and k-group variants add boundary tracking and availability checking.
The dummy node provides a stable anchor when the head might change.
