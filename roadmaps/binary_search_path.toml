# ===== Step 1: Foundation - Boundary Search =====
[[steps]]
order = 1
problem = "0035_search_insert_position"
role = "base"
pattern = "binary_search_lower_bound"
prerequisite = []
delta = ""
note = "Learn the canonical lower_bound template. Foundation for all boundary searches."

[[steps]]
order = 2
problem = "0034_find_first_and_last_position_of_element_in_sorted_array"
role = "base"
pattern = "binary_search_lower_bound"
prerequisite = ["0035"]
delta = "Combine lower_bound and upper_bound for range queries."
note = "Apply lower_bound twice to find first and last occurrence."

# ===== Step 2: Rotated Array Search =====
[[steps]]
order = 3
problem = "0033_search_in_rotated_sorted_array"
role = "base"
pattern = "binary_search_rotated"
prerequisite = ["0035"]
delta = "Identify sorted half, then check if target lies in that range."
note = "Key insight: one half is always sorted after rotation."

order = 4
problem = "0081_search_in_rotated_sorted_array_ii"
role = "variant"
pattern = "binary_search_rotated_duplicates"
prerequisite = ["0033"]
delta = "Handle ambiguous case (left == mid == right) with linear shrink."
note = "Duplicates can cause worst-case O(n). Practice handling edge cases."

# ===== Step 3: Peak Finding =====
[[steps]]
order = 5
problem = "0162_find_peak_element"
role = "base"
pattern = "binary_search_peak_finding"
prerequisite = ["0035"]
delta = "Use slope direction instead of value comparison."
note = "Ascending slope means peak is on right; descending means peak is at mid or left."

# ===== Step 4: Binary Search on Answer Space =====
[[steps]]
order = 6
problem = "0875_koko_eating_bananas"
role = "base"
pattern = "binary_search_on_answer"
prerequisite = ["0035"]
delta = "Binary search on answer value, not array index."
note = "Classic minimize-the-maximum. Search answer space [1, max(piles)]."

[[steps]]
order = 7
problem = "1011_capacity_to_ship_packages_within_d_days"
role = "variant"
pattern = "binary_search_minimize_maximum"
prerequisite = ["0875"]
delta = "Answer space is [max(weights), sum(weights)]. Greedy feasibility."
note = "Same pattern as Koko. Practice the minimize-maximum template."

# ===== Advanced (Future) =====

# order = 8
# problem = "0410_split_array_largest_sum"
# role = "variant"
# pattern = "binary_search_minimize_maximum"
# prerequisite = ["0875", "1011"]
# delta = "Minimize the largest subarray sum when splitting into k parts."
# note = "Harder variant requiring DP intuition for feasibility check."

# [[steps]]
# order = 9
# problem = "0153_find_minimum_in_rotated_sorted_array"
# role = "variant"
# pattern = "binary_search_rotated"
# prerequisite = ["0033"]
# delta = "Find pivot point (minimum) instead of searching for target."
# note = "Complementary to search - find the rotation point."

# order = 10
# problem = "0852_peak_index_in_a_mountain_array"
# role = "variant"
# pattern = "binary_search_peak_finding"
# prerequisite = ["0162"]
# delta = "Guaranteed single peak (mountain shape)."
# note = "Simpler version of peak finding with guaranteed unimodal array."
