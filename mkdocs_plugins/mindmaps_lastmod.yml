# Note:
# All paths below must be specified relative to docs_dir (usually docs_dir = docs/)
# For example:
#   - If your mind map HTML files are under docs/pages/mindmaps/, use path: pages/mindmaps/
#   - Do NOT include the "docs/" prefix.

rules:
  - path: pages/mindmaps/
    extensions: [".html"]

  # example: if you also have another static mindmaps directory
  # - path: mindmaps/
  #   extensions: [".html", ".htm"]
